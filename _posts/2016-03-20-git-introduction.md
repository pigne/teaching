### Avant Propos

This page contains a very short, partial and incomplete sum-up of chapter 1, 2 and 3 of the [**Pro Git book**](http://git-scm.com/book) written by *Scott Chacon* ([CC BY-NC-SA 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/)). This is not a standalone course. This should be considered as "speech notes" for the in-class lecture.

### Some definitions

- **Diff**: a command line tool that shows, on a line-basis, the differences between two text files.

- **Repository**:  more or less a whole database of files and their history.

- **Working copy/directory**:  a local set of files and folders (a project) that contains, not only, files from a version system. Working copies are used to create new snapshots (new versions) in the version system.

- **Snapshot**:  instantaneous state of the files in a filesystem (project / folder / set of files).

- **commit**: a set of changes applied to the repository that constitute an atomic new version in the versioning system.

- **branch**: An diverged set of commits from the original flow of commits.

## About Version Control

Different types of version control systems have evolved.

</section>
<section>


### Version Control System (VCS)

- Manual local copies of individual files.
- `+` Easy to use.
- `-` Error prone.
- `-` No team work.
- **tools**: rcs

<p class="text-center figure">
![Local Version Control Systems.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/vcs-diag.png)
</p>


</section>
<section>

### Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)

- A single central server contains all the versioned files (the repository). Users only old working copies.
- `+` Allows collaboration and team work,
- `-` One single point of failure.
- `-` Most of the operations require a network connection (slow).
- `-` Branches are a pain to deal with.
- **tools**: CVS, Subversion
, ...

<p class="text-center figure">
![Centralized Version Control Systems.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/cvcs-diag.png)
</p>

</section>
<section>


### Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)

- Each collaborator/client contains the whole set of versioned files (the whole repository) with history, branches and all.
- After a server crash, any user's repository can be copied back to the server.
- `+` No single point of failure.
- `+` Most operation are local. No network connection needed (fast).
- `+` Thousands of branches can be gracefully handled.
- **tools**:  Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs


</section>
<section>

### Snapshot, not differences

Most Version Systems use a file-based and file modification-based storage system. Each revision is composed of a list of differences for each modified file.
<p class="text-center figure">
![Other VCS Data Storage System]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/otherStoreSystems.png)
</p>

In Git revisions are snapshots. Each one is like a filesystem. Only modified files are copied, the others are linked.

<p class="text-center figure">
![GIT Data Storage System.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/gitStoreSystem.png)
</p>


</section>
<section>

### Mostly Local Operations

- Getting a previous version of a file, doing a `diff` between two versions, can be done locally without any connection to the Server.
- Client can commit while offline/off-VPN because the all repository is available locally.
- This means most operation are fast!


</section>
<section>

### Check-sum

- Since there is no single point of synchronization (no central server) revisions can't be numbered sequentially.
- Revisions are identified with a check-sum based on the snapshot contents.
- GIT uses the SHA-1 hash algorithm to produce (most certainly) unique ids.
- A SHA-1 hash is a 40-hexadecimal string. (16<sup>40</sup> possible combinations).

</section>
<section>

### Git Generally Only Adds Data

By default we never remove anything from git.

`+` Nothing ever gets lost. Even if a file is removed in a new revision, it still exists in the history.

`-` Users need to be careful at what they commit. We don't version binaries, compiled files, logs...



</section>
<section>

### The Three States


3 possible states for a file :

- **committed** : the file in its current version is stored in the repository.
- **modified** : some modifications have occurred on the file and are not yet committed.
- **staged** : a modified file has been selected to be part of the next commit snapshot. This state is important, it allows to chose which file to commit.


As a consequence there are 3 sections (locations) in a git project :

- the **working directory**;
- the **staging area**
- the **repository** (git directory)

### Install Git

- On Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

- On Windows
	- Many possibilities...
	- http://msysgit.github.io/
	- http://windows.github.com/

### Configure Git

One tool to configure git : `git config`.

```bash
git config --list
```

3 configuration levels:
- the system level : `--system` option, modifies `/etc/gitconfig`
- the user level : `--global`option, modifies '~/.gitconfig'
- the repository level : no option, modifies `.git/config`


#### Identity

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

#### Editor

```bash
git config --global core.editor emacs
```

#### Diff tool

Any of  kdiff3, tkdiff, meld, xxdiff, emerge, vimdiff, gvimdiff, ecmerge, and opendiff

```bash
$ git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

```

### Getting Help


```bash
$ git help <verb>
$ git <verb> --help
$ man git-<verb>
```

## Git Basics




</section>
<section>

### Initializing a new Repository

Usually you already have a folder with a project in it. Source files and so.

`git init` initializes a new repository.

```bash
cd myProject
git init
git add "*.java"
git commit -m "Initial commit for myProject"
```


</section>
<section>

### Clone an existing project

`git clone` pulls a complete repository to the local directory.

Warning : other VCS like Subversion use `checkout`. With `checkout` you only get a branch (a working directory). `clone` gets the whole repository (history, branches, tags...)


```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pigne/CountDownWebApp.git
```

Various transfer protocol are possible and depend on the server:

- `git://`,
- `http(s)://`,
- `user@server:/path.git`.


</section>
<section>

### Life cycle of a file

A file can be **tracked** or **untracked**. If it is tracked it is whether **unmodified**, **modified**, or **staged**.

- untracked
- tracked
	- unmodified
	- modified
	- staged


<p class="text-center figure">
![File Status Life Cycle.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/fileLifeCycle.png)
</p>


</section>
<section>

### Checking the Status of Files

The main tool for checking the status of files is `git status`.

```bash
$ git status
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

See `git help status`.



</section>
<section>

### Start tracking a file

- Start editing a file... Say `AUTHORS`
- Check the status with `git status`

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Initial commit
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	AUTHORS
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

- Start tracking with `git add`

```
$ git add AUTHORS
$ git status
On branch master
Initial commit
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   AUTHORS
```


</section>
<section>

### Staging a modified file

When an already tracked file is modified we see it with `git status`

```bash
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   src/main/java/org/pigne/CountDown.java
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

Staging a file for commit is also done with `git add`

```bash
$ git add src/main/java/org/pigne/CountDown.java
$ git status
# ...
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   src/main/java/org/pigne/CountDown.java
```


</section>
<section>

### Ignoring files

Some file we don't want to store in the repository

- compiled files (\*.class, \*.o, \*.so, Eclipse's `bin` folder),
- dependencies and external libraries,
- archive/deployment files (\*.tar, \*.jar, \*.zip),
- log and backup files (\*.log, \*~),
- local IDE / Editor configuration (Eclipse's `.settings/` `.classpath` `.project`).

The `.gitignore` file contains regex patterns to ignore such files :

```bash
target/
.projets
.settings/
.classpath
```


</section>
<section>

### Staged and Unstaged changes

`git diff` : line per line diff between files.

- `git diff` with no arguments to see what is *changed* but *not yet staged*.
- `git diff --staged` to see what is *staged*.


</section>
<section>

### Committing Your Changes

`git commit` will actually take a snapshot of the staged files set and add it to the repository

- `git commit` with non argument will open the default text editor, waiting for a commit message.
- `git commit -m "My commit message that details what happens here..."` to give an inline commit message.



</section>
<section>

### Removing a file

- Removing a file from both the repository and the fiesystem

```bash
 git rm readme.txt
```

- Removing a file from the repository **but** keeping it in the filesystem (stop tracking the file):

```bash
 git rm --cached readme.txt
```


</section>
<section>

### Moving Files

As well as removing files, moving files also require to be committed.

```bash
$ git mv file_from file_to
```

Then `file_to` is staged for the next commit.



</section>
<section>

### Viewing the Commits History

```bash
$ git log
$ git help log
```

Better use GUI to see git history:

- Linux : git-cola, gitg, git gui, qgit, SmartGit
- Mac / Windows : github GUI


</section>
<section>

### Unstage files

*You did not commit but messed around with the working copy and the stage.*

- Unstage a file that was not already in the repository:

```bash
$ git rm --cached <file>
```

- Unstage a file that already exists:

```bash
$ git reset HEAD <file>
```

- forget unstaged modifications and revert to unmodified version

```bash
$ git checkout  HEAD -- <file>
```


</section>
<section>


### Moving through files states

</section>

### Undo commits

*So you committed but it does not compile? Or maybe you committed  a ".class" file? This is bad...*

- Undo last commit but keep your modifications in the working directory :

```bash
$ git reset HEAD~1
```

- You are sure you really don't want to keep anything from this commit:

```bash
$ git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

- Forget all your local modifications on a file and come back to the last committed version in the repository:

```bash
$ git checkout  HEAD -- <file>
```

### Remotes

In order to collaborate, common repositories have to be accessible from servers (remotes). Clients will be pushing and pulling data between their repository to other repositories.

The `git remote` command helps dealing with those repositories.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pigne/CountDownWebApp.git
$ cd CountDownWebApp
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/pigne/CountDownWebApp.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/pigne/CountDownWebApp.git (push)
```
Add a remote with `git remote add [shortname] [url]`


</section>
<section>

### Fetch and Pull from Remotes

`git fetch [remote-name]` will retrieve **any** new material from the given remote into the **local repository**.

- Fetching a remote only affects the **local repository**. It does not change the **working directory**.

- In order to mix the changes  from the remote into the local branch, we need to `merge`.

- by default (after a `git clone`), the local "master" branch is synchronized with the remote's "master" branch.

- `git pull` will do several steps :
	- fetch from a remote
	- merge the remote's master to the local master.  This might affect the **working directory**



</section>
<section>

###Push to the Remote
Once local changes have been committed to the local repository, we publish them to the remote server with `git push [remote-name] [branch-name]`


Usually the remote is called "origin" and the default branch is "master"

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

- Inspect a remote with `git remote show [remote-name]`.
- Rename a remote with `git remote rename [old-name] [new-name]`.
- Remove a remote with `git remote remove [remote-name]`.

</p>

### Tagging

Tags allow to associate textual information on a commit. Mostly useful for software releases.

- List all tags with `git tag`

#### Annotated tags
A new commit is created with it.

```bash
$ git tag -a v1.4 -m 'my version 1.4'
```

#### Lightweight Tags

No other information is kept, only a file with the hash of the previous commit is stored.

```bash
$ git tag v1.4-lw
```

#### Tagging an older revision

```bash
$ git tag -a v1.2 -m 'version 1.2' 9fceb02
```

#### Sharing tags

By default git push does not propagates tags, we have to specify it:

```bash
$ git push origin v1.5
$ # or
$ git push origin --tags
```

## Branches

The best advantage of Git over the other VCS and DVCS.
Branches are fast and easy to merge.



</section>
<section>


### Commits' Network Representation

Commit in Git are identified by a unique number (check-sum) and one of more links to **parent commits**.

<p class="text-center  wide-image noborder-image">
![Commits Linked with their parents]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/commitsNetwork.svg)
</p>


</section>
<section>


### Branches are Pointers

A branch is a simple pointer to one of the commits in the repository.

- On the first commit of a repository, a default branch is created : `master`
- Each time a new branch is created (`git branch cli_branch`), a new pointer is created.
- `HEAD` is a spacial pointer that indicates which branch the **working directory** is in.

<p class="text-center  wide-image	 noborder-image">
![Branches and HEAD Point to commits]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/newBranch.svg)
</p>


</section>
<section>



### Working in Branches

`git checkout <branch-name>` moves the `HEAD` to the given branch and puts the snapshot of that commit into the **working directory**.

- A commit on a branch moves that branch to the new commit
- A commit on a branch does not change the others branches.
- The special  pointer `HEAD` moves with the current branch when commits occur on it.

```bach
$ git checkout cli_branch  # moves HEAD
$ # modify some_file
$ git add some_file
$ git commit # moves cli_branch & HEAD
```

<p class="text-center  wide-image	 noborder-image">
![Commits in branches]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/commitBranches.svg)
</p>



</section>
<section>


### Diverging History

Committing from various branches makes the history of the repository diverge.

```bash
$ git checkout master  # moves HEAD
$ # modify some_file
$ git add some_file
$ git commit # moves master & HEAD
```

<p class="text-center  wide-image	 noborder-image">
![Diverging History]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/diverged.svg)
</p>


</section>
<section>


### Merging Branches

As soon as concurrent modifications are finished, we want to reintegrate branches with `git merge`

- To merge branch B in branch A, one have to call `merge` from branch A.
- Merging 2 branches will create a new commit with 2 (or more) parents.
- Conflicts may happen.

```bash
$ git checkout master       ## be sure we are in destination branch
$ git merge cli_branch
$ git branch -d cli_branch  ## remove cli_branch as it is useless
```


</section>
<section>

![Diverging History]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/merging.svg)
</p>


</section>
<section>

###Resolving conflicts

In case of conflict the commit is aborted and problematic files are unmerged

```bash
$ git status
index.html: needs merge
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#   unmerged:   index.html
#
```

- Use `git mergetool` to call one of the merging tools available (kdiff3,tkdiff,xxdiff,meld,gvimdiff,opendiff,emerge,vimdiff).
- Or edit the unmerged files.

```bash
<<<<<<< HEAD:index.html
<div id="footer">contact : email.support@github.com</div>
=======
<div id="footer">
  please contact us at support@github.com
</div>
>>>>>>> iss53:index.html
```

- At the end re-stage files and commit.



</section>
<section>

### Remote branches

Remote branches are references to the state of branches on your remote repositories. They‚Äôre local branches that you can‚Äôt move.

- A remote branch is denoted as `[remote_name]/[branch_name]` (e.g. `origin/master`)
- `git clone` will set local `master` according to `origin/master`
- when you commit on `master` but do not "push", then you are "ahead".
- We can push a local branch to a remote:
```bash
$ git push origin cli_branch
```

- We can create a new local branch that "tracks" a remote one:

```bash
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout -b bogus123 origin/fix_bug_123
```

- any `git pull` or `git push` from the branch `bogus123` will refer to remote  `origin` with branch `fix_bug_123`.


### test

Nope.
